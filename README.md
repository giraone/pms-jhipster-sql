# pmssql

Test application for database performance with company/employee model.

## JHipster

See [ORIGINAL-README-jhipster.md](ORIGINAL-README-jhipster.md) for the original JHipster README.
Most of the generated resources and services are left untouched to be used as an administraion (CRUD) api.
The added resources are using the base URL `/domain-api` and all classes are named _<Entity>DomainResource_,
_<Entity>DomainService_ and _<Entity>DomainImpl_.

## Build and run

```
# Run with development settings
./mvnw
# Run with production settings
./mvnw -Pprod
# Docker run with production settings
./mvnw -Pprod jib:dockerBuild
# Normal Maven production build
mvn -Pprod package
# Manual Java run
java -jar target/pmssql-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
# Frontend with life reload
npm start
```

If running in production mode, use `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d` to start the
production PostgreSQL database. It will use a docker volume in `~/volumes/jhipster/pmssql/postgresql`.

You can also run a _pgAdmin4_ using `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/pgadmin4.yml up -d`.
Both docker compose files share a common network

## Database model

![Data Model](jhipster-jdl.png 'Data Model')

## Re-create data model

```
jhipster import-jdl ./jhipster-jdl.jh --force
```

## Security

In constrast to the standard JHipster generated projects, only users with the role ADMIN can access the
generated CRUD REST services under the `/api` URL. All REST interfaces for "normal" users are placed
under the URL `domain-api` and are authorized to reflect \*multi-tenancy` (a user of a company can see
only employees of his/her company).

## CURL samples (admin API)

```
BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

token=$(curl "${BASE_URL}/api/authenticate" -s -k -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}' | jq -r ".id_token")

curl "${BASE_URL}/api/companies?page=0&size=20&sort=id,asc" -k -H 'Accept: application/json' \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"

curl "${BASE_URL}/api/employees?page=0&size=20&sort=id,asc" -k -H 'Accept: application/json' \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"

curl "${BASE_URL}/api/employee-names?page=0&size=20&sort=id,asc" -k -H 'Accept: application/json' \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"
```

## CURL samples (domain API)

The first PUT call uses data from [the testdata-generator project on GitHub](https://github.com/giraone/testdata-generator).

```

curl "${BASE_URL}/domain-api/employee-list" -k -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" -X PUT  --data @../data-10M/d-00000000/f-00000000.json

curl "${BASE_URL}/domain-api/employees?companyExternalId=l-00000060&surnamePrefix=A&page=0&size=20&sort=id,asc" \
 -k -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"
curl "${BASE_URL}/domain-api/employees?companyExternalId=l-00000060&surnamePrefix=Ar&page=0&size=20&sort=id,asc" \
 -k -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"

curl "${BASE_URL}/domain-api/employees?surnamePrefix=X&page=0&size=20&externalCompanyId=l-00000060&sort=id,asc \
 -k -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"

curl "${BASE_URL}/domain-api/re-index?clear=false" -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"
```

## Performance of bulk load

-   Bulk load with 10 Mio employees on local PC with docker PostgreSQL: 120 minutes

## Some design decisions

### Redundant storage of "normalized" and "phonetic names"

-   The used SQL table `EntityName` has no object id. It is managed by JPA and its
    primary key is a composite key of all 3 columns (`owner_id`, `name_key`, `name_value`).
-   Due to the fact, that a surname may consist of multiple values, the `name_value` must be part of the primary key.
-   `EntityName` values are deleted via `ON CASCADE DELETE` using Liquibase - this is not done by JPA/Hibernate!
-   `EntityName` are create by customizing the standard `JpaRepository<Employee, Long>` using an overwritten `save(Employee)` method.
